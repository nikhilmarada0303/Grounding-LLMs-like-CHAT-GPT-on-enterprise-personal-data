OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Yes, we've highlighted a crucial aspect of LLMs like ChatGPT. While they are powerful tools for natural language understanding and generation, their effectiveness is largely dependent on the data they are trained on. If you have specific domain-specific questions or want insights from data that weren't part of the general training data, you would indeed need to fine-tune or "ground" the LLM on your personal or enterprise data.

For instance, if you want to know the strength of ECE (Electronics and Communication Engineering) students in your college, you could collect data about student enrollments, academic performance, or any other relevant metrics, and then fine-tune a language model like ChatGPT on this data. Once fine-tuned, the model may be better equipped to understand and respond to queries related to ECE student strength in your college.

This approach allows you to leverage the power of LLMs while tailoring them to your specific needs and data, enabling more personalized and accurate results for your particular domain or enterprise.

WHY NOT FINETUNING:

Fine Tuning is very costly , so we go for grounding.

HOW I DONE THE PROJECT:

I have injusted the personal data to search engine , and i have integrated bot with search engine and GPT.

So while injusting the data to search engine , it cannot take large amount of data at same time , so it will break into small chunks.

I've integrated a search engine with a conversational bot powered by an LLM like GPT. If the data you've indexed in your search engine is too large to handle all at once, breaking it into smaller chunks is a sensible approach. When a user asks a question to the search engine, the search engine will then retrieve relevant chunks of data that match the query.

Once the search engine retrieves the relevant data, it can pass it to your conversational bot, which then uses the GPT model to generate a response based on the retrieved information. The bot processes the user's query and the retrieved data, potentially combining them to formulate a coherent and informative response.

This setup allows for a dynamic interaction where the user's query is processed by both the search engine and the conversational bot, leveraging the strengths of each component to provide accurate and relevant answers to the user's questions. If the data is organized and indexed effectively, this approach can efficiently handle large volumes of data while still providing timely and accurate responses to user queries.
